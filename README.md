# Revalex Technologies Website

This site is deployed via **GitHub Pages** as a **Project Page**.

- Production URL: `https://revalex-technologies.github.io/Revalex-Technologies-Home/`
- Local dev: `yarn dev`
- Local preview: `yarn preview`
- Build: `yarn build`
- The Vite `base` is set to `/Revalex-Technologies-Home/` so assets resolve correctly under the project subpath.
- To use a custom domain later, set `VITE_BASE` to `'/'` in the Pages build step or update `vite.config.ts` accordingly.
